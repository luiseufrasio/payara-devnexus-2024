### Adding a User for Form-Based Authentication with File Realm
If you are using form-based authentication with file realm, you can create a user with the following command:

```
asadmin create-file-user --groups=user --target=server-config --authrealmname=file myuser
```
This command creates a user with the username `myuser` and assigns them to the `user` group. You can adjust the username and group as needed for your authentication setup.
